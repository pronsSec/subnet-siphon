Subnet-Siphon is a Python command-line tool designed to process large lists of IP subnets. It efficiently removes duplicates, specifically targeting more specific subnets in a list containing both general and specific subnet entries. Using advanced data handling via dask, this tool can efficiently handle large lists with little resource usage. Or with more resources it can work very powerfully and quickly.

## Features

- **Efficient Processing**: Capable of handling large lists containing millions of IP subnets due to advanced data pre and post processing. Dask is used to provided advanced data handling and significant speed increases paired with less resource strain than purely python implementations.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removes more specific subnet entries when a general version of the same subnet exists in the list.
- **Support for IPv4 and IPv6**: Handles both IPv4 and IPv6 subnet lists.
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides detailed progress updates with an estimated time to completion for each step.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes validation and error handling for improved reliability.
- **Rich Terminal Output**: Utilizes the `rich` library for modern, colorful, and formatted CLI output.
- **Output Flexibility**: Outputs the cleaned list in both CSV and text file formats.
